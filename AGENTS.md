This is a client/frontend for the Serchat chatting application. It is in many respects similar to Discord, but open-source.

The API is not stable; you can assume you do not need to support older versions of the backend when you make changes to API code. You can find a OpenAPI description of most of the HTTP-based API in `openapi.yaml`.

You can reference the backend at the following URL: https://github.com/Serval-Chat/backend

You can run this project with `clickable desktop --no-nvidia`. NEVER try to manually run or compile this application without using clickable, it will never work.
